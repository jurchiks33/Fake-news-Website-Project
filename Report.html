<h1>Juris Slisans</h1>
<h2><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Story for a current site was taken from a current situation in a world.
It is hard for human being to know which resource to trust, and it doesn't matter it is newspaper or news on TV.
in a given website was given example how in a short time with some skill set and help of search engines
is possible create website on which one can post all it like. Current website was developed in a fake new style 
and hint of a humour in a text to didn't make appearance dramatic.</p>
<h2><strong>Inspiration:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Website creation was inspired by intensive media propaganda during the invasion in Ukraine.
It was to make example for a visitors to see how easy is to fabricate news and all necessary data for it. People visiting
website can see how easy is to manipulate data online and understand if a single person can do it, team of many can accomplish same result
much faster and with more fabricated news. </p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Bloggers supporting fight against the fake news also played an important role in a website creation</p>
<h2><strong>Accessibility:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>1)</strong> Making sure the website is compatible with web standards like HTML5 and ARIA, which provide additional markup and attributes that help assistive technologies understand the structure and purpose of web content.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>2)</strong> Website is accessible true the internet browsers like Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and other popular web browsers</p> 
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>3)</strong> Website is accessible true mobile devices, i pads, and other network reading devices</p>
<h2><strong>Usability:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>1)</strong>Simplifying design to make it easier for users to navigate and use the website.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>2)</strong>Provided clear and concise content which is written in clear and concise language that is easy for users to understand.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>3)</strong>Ensuring fast loading times, slow loading times can frustrate users and lead to a negative experience.</p>
<h2><strong>Learning:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>1)</strong> I had to read extra material on JavaScript, which i achieved by reading books on JavaScript</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>2)</strong> Extra material on CSS and HTML was a necessary to implement extra styling and layout for a website, it was achieved by using online materials and reading books</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>3)</strong> Visual content management, to find all needed pictures and videos and also licensing for them.</p>
<h2><strong>Evaluation I:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Particularly successful in my opinion was a part of a CSS styling, i really liked that part and that is one of the reasons why it was easy to accomplish after reading additional online resources.
Also part with HTML language was easy to grasp, since it involved some amount of structure which made it more easy to remember and use in a work.</p>
<h2><strong>Evaluation II:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Ability to write scripts and link them to the documents would be a nice improvement since they used most of the time in a web development. Another time i would add extra content for a website, also 
would like to use more scripts in a webpage to make it more interesting for a end user. There are also many gaps in a CSS which would be improved for extra effects but one guess practice makes it perfect.
Another time i would also invest more time on planning site style and layout, i am really glad with navigation bar and pictures in a site, but for a contact us page i feel that it is missing some extra styling on it. 
Also by some reason cannot link my scripts from an external script page and must use scripts at the bottom of the HTML page
will need to work out what happened, so far pages was linked correctly, at least links forward me from HTML to script page</p>
<h2><strong>Resources:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Resources used in a work are: w3schools, Developer mozilla org, Books: HTML&CSS. Jon Duckett, JavaScript&Jquery. Jon Duckett. </p>
